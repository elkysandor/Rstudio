### Q0.Submission Instructions (Please read carefully)   



The exam will be submitted **individually** by uploading the solved exam `Rmd` and `html` files to the course `moodle`. 

Please name your files as `52414-HomeExam_ID.Rmd` and `52414-HomeExam_ID.html` where `ID` is replaced by your ID number (do **not** write your name in the file name or in the exam itself).

The number of points for each sub-question is indicated next to it, with $105$ points overall. The total grade will be at most $100$. 



Once you click on the `moodle` link for the home exam, the exam will start and you have three days (72 hours) to complete and submit it. 

The exam will be available from July 18th to July 30th. The last submission time is June 30th at 23:59. <br>

You may use all course materials, the web and other written materials and R libraries. 

You are NOT allowed to discuss any of the exam questions/materials with other students. 





**Analysis and Presentation of Results:**



Write your answers and explanations in the text of the `Rmd` file (*not* in the `code`). <br>

The text of your answers should be next to the relevant code, plots and tables and refer to them, and not at a separate place at the end. <br>

You need to explain every step of your analysis. When in doubt, a more detailed explanation is better than omitting explanations. 



Give informative titles, axis names and names for each curve/bar in your graphs. 

In some graphs you may need to change the graph limits. If you do so, please include the outlier points you have removed in a separate table.  <br>

Add informative comments explaining your code <br>



Whenever possible, use *objective* and *specific* terms and quantities learned in class, and avoid *subjective* and *general* unquantified statements. For example: <br>

`Good:` "We see a $2.5$-fold increase in the curve from Jan. 1st to March 1st". <br>

`Bad:` "The curve goes up at the beginning". <br>

`Good:` "The median is $4.7$. We detected five outliers with distance $>3$ standard deviations from the median". <br>

`Bad:` "The five points on the sides seem far from the middle". 



Sometimes `Tables` are the best way to present your results (e.g. when asked for a list of items). Exclude irrelevant

rows/columns. Display clearly items' names in your `Tables`.



Show numbers in plots/tables using standard digits and not scientific display. 

That is: 90000000 and not 9e+06.  

Round numbers to at most 3 digits after the dot - that is, 9.456 and not 9.45581451044



Some questions may require data wrangling and manipulation which you need to 

decide on. The instructions may not specify precisely the exact plot you should use

(for example: `show the distribution of ...`). In such cases, you should decide what and how to show the results. 



When analyzing real data, use your best judgment if you encounter missing values, negative values, NaNs, errors in the data etc. (e.g. excluding them, zeroing negative values..) and mention what you have done in your analysis in such cases. 



Required libraries are called in the `Rmd` file. Install any library missing from your `R` environment. You are allowed to add additional libraries if you want. 

If you do so, *please add them at the start of the Rmd file, right below the existing libraries, and explain what libraries you've added, and what is each new library used for*.

## Q1. Two Armies Simulation (45 pt)    

<img src="https://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/previews/1923/19232816-toy-soldiers-war-concepts.jpg" alt="soldiers" width="300"/>



Consider two armies of $10$ `R` loving statisticians and $10$ `Python` loving statisticians, facing each other in a shootout, fighting to the death over which language is better. 



Once the battle starts, assume that each statistician tries to shoot as fast as she can, where the time until shooting has an exponential distribution with $\lambda=1$. After a shot is fired, the statistician keeps firing, with the time to the next shot again distributed as $exp(1)$. Each statistician keeps shooting until she is shot and killed herself by a statistician from the opposing army, and leaves the battle. The times until shooting the next bullet for all statisticians and all shots are independent. <br>

At each shot, the statistician chooses as target **uniformly at random** a member from the remaining **living members** of the opposing army. 

<br>

The battle keeps going until all persons from one of the armies die, and then the other army is declared the `winner`. 

Let $X$ be the number of remaining statisticians from the `winner` army when the battle ends. <br>

Throughout this question, assume that statisticians are **perfect shooters**, and always hit their target (the choice of the target changes however between different sub-questions below).





a. (5pt) Describe in words a simulation strategy to estimate $E[X]$ and $Var(X)$, including how would you simulate a battle between the two armies. <br>

**Hint:** remember that the exponential distribution has a memoryless property: $Pr(T>t) = Pr(T > t+s | T>s)$, $\forall t, s > 0$. <br>

You can perform the simulations in this question exactly as described, which may take many minutes to run, or perform **simpler** and **faster** simulations using probabilistic arguments, provided that they are **equivalent** to the description in the question. <br>

(For example, if you were requested to simulate $n$ i.i.d. $Bernouli(p)$ random variables and report their sum, you could argue that instead it is enough to simulate a single $Bionomial(n,p)$ random variable).





b. (8pt) Simulate $1,000$ random battles as described in the question and use them to estimate $E[X]$ and $Var(X)$ from the random simulations.  <br>

It is recommended to write a function for the simulation and call it, such that the simulation function can be used also in the subsequent sub-questions. 





c. (8pt) Now, change $n$, the number of statisticians in each army, to be $n=10, 20, 40, ..., 10240$ (each time multiplying $n$ by two), and let $X_n$ be the random variable counting the number of remaining winners when starting with $n$ statisticians in each army. (so the variable $X$ from (a.) corresponds to $X_{10}$). <br>

For each value of $n$ simulate $100$ random battles and estimate $\mu_n \equiv E[X_n]$. 

Plot your estimate vs. $n$. <br>

Find a simple function $f(n)$ such that it holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$ based on the plot. 

(**Hint:** you can use log-scale). 





d. (8pt) In this sub-question, assume that all statisticians in both armies have used their programming language too much so they became to hate it, and therefore in each shot they aim and kill a random member from their **own** army (including possibly themselves). <br>

Modify the simulation to accommodate this case, and repeat the simulation, plot and finding a function $f(n)$ as in (c.) for this case. <br>

Explain in words the differences in results between the two cases. 





e. (8pt) In this sub-question, assume that all statisticians in both armies are **completely drunk**, and shoot randomly one of the **remaining persons alive** (from both armies) including themselves (they still always hit their target).  

Repeat (d.) for this case. Are the results similar or different? why? 





f. (8pt) Finally, suppose in this sub-question that statisticians that are shot become zombies instead of being killed, and can still keep shooting at statisticians from the opposing army (as in (a.), (b.)). <br>

All statisticians aim at and hit a random **living** (non-zombie) member from the opposing army. The battle ends when all members of a certain army become zombies, and then $X_n$ records the number of remaining living (non-zombie) statisticians in the other army. <br>

Repeat the simulation, plot and finding a function $f(n)$ as in (c.) for this case. <br>

Explain in words the differences in results between the this and the previous cases.

## Q2. Analysis and Visualization of Twitter Data (60 pt)    



<img src="https://cdn-0.therandomvibez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jokes-On-New-Years-Resolution.jpg" alt="resolutions" width="300"/>





a. (4pt) Download and read the tweets dataset file `New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv` available [here](https://github.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2021/blob/master/New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv). 

The data represents new year's resolutions tweets by American users wishing to change something in their life at the stat of the year $2015$, downloaded from [here](https://data.world/crowdflower/2015-new-years-resolutions#). <br>

Make sure that the tweets `text` column has `character` type. 

Show the top and bottom two rows of the resulting data-frame. 





b. (5pt) Create a new column with tweet times, of class `times`, with the time of the day for each tweet, in the format: `Hours:Minutes:Seconds` (see `DateTimeClasses` for more). For example, the first entry in the column corresponding to the time of the first tweet should be: `10:48:00`. <br>

The class `times` stores and displays times in the above format, but also treats them as numeric values between zero and one in units of days. For example, the time `10:48:00` corresponds to the value: $(10 + 48/60)/24 = 0.45$. <br>

Make a histogram showing the number of tweets in every hour of the $24$ hours in a day (that is, the bins are times between `00:00` and `00:59`, between `01:00` and `01:59` etc.). <br>

At which hours do we see the most/fewest tweets?





c. (6pt) Plot the distribution of tweets `text` lengths (in characters) made by `females` and `males` separately. Who writes longer tweets? <br>

Repeat, but this time plot the tweets lengths distribution for tweets in the four different regions of the US

(`Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`). Report the major differences in lengths between regions. <br>

Finally, show the tweets lengths distribution for tweets for the $10$ different categories given in `Resolution_Category`. Report the major differences in lengths between categories. 





d. (8pt) Compute the number of occurrences of each word in the `text` of all the tweets. Ignore upper/lower case differences. <br>

Remove words containing the special characters: `#`, `@`, `&`, `-`, `.`, `:` and `?`. <br>

Remove also non-informative words: `resolution`, `rt`, `2015` and the empty word. <br>

Plot the top $100$ remaining words in a word cloud, using the `wordcloud2` package. <br>





e. (8pt) Find for each of the top (most frequent) $100$ words from 2.(d.) and each of the $10$ tweet categories, the fraction of tweets from this category where the word appears, and list them in a $100 \times 10$ table $F$, with $f_{ij}$ indicating the frequency of word $i$ in category $j$. <br>

That is, if for example there were $200$ tweets in the category `Humor`, and $30$ of them contained the word `joke`, then the frequency was $0.15$. <br>

Finally, for each of the $10$ categories we want to find the most `characteristic` words, i.e. words appearing more frequently in this category compared to other categories: <br>

Formally, compute for each word $i$ and each category $j$ the difference between the frequency in the category and the maximum over frequencies in other categories: $d_{ij} = f_{ij} - \max_{k \neq j} f_{ik}$.

(For example, if the word `joke` had frequency $0.15$ in `Humor`, and the next highest frequency for this word in other categories is $0.1$, then the difference for this word is $0.05$).

Find for each category $j$ of the $10$ categories the $3$ `characteristic` words with the highest differences $d_{ij}$. Show a table with the $10$ categories and the $3$ `characteristic` words you have found for each of them. Do the words make sense for the categories? 





f. (5pt) Plot the number of tweets in each of the $10$ categories shown in `Resolution_Category`. <br>

Next, compute and show in a table of size $10 \times 4$ the number of tweets for each of the $10$ categories from users in each of the four regions of the USA: `Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`. 







g. (8pt) We want to test the null hypothesis that users in different `regions`  have the same distribution over `categories` for their resolutions, using the Pearson chi-square statistic: 

$$

S = \sum_{i=1}^{10} \sum_{j=1}^{4} \frac{(o_{ij}-e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}

$$

where $o_{ij}$ is the number of tweets on category $i$ from region $j$ computed in the table in the previous sub-question, assuming some indexing for the categories and regions (for example, $j=1,2,3,4$ for `Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`, respectively, and similarly for the categories). The expected counts $e_{ij}$ are given by: 

$$

e_{ij} = \frac{o_{ \bullet j} o_{i \bullet}  }  {o_{\bullet \bullet}}

$$

where $o_{i \bullet}$ is the sum over the $i$'th row (over all regions), $o_{\bullet j}$  the sum over the $j$'th column (over all categories) and $o_{\bullet \bullet}$ the sum over all observations in the table. These expected counts correspond to independence between the row (categories) and column (regions) according to the null hypothesis. <br>

Compute and report the test statistic for the table computed in 2.(f). <br>

Use the approximation $S \sim \chi^2(27)$ to compute a p-value for the above test (there are $(4-1) \times (10-1) = 27$ degrees of freedom). Would you reject the null hypothesis? <br>

Finally, repeat the analysis (computing a table, $\chi^2$-statistic and p-value) but this time split tweets by `gender` (`male` and `female`) instead of by `region`, to get a $10 \times 2$ table. Is there a significant difference in the distribution of categories between males and females?





h. (8pt) Use the following simulation to create a randomized dataset of `(category, region)` pairs for the tweets: <br>

For each tweet in the dataset keep the real `category` (from the column `Resolution_Category`) but change the `region` randomly by shuffling (permuting) the regions column in a random order, such that the total number of tweets from each region remains the same. <br>

Repeat this simulation $N=1,000$ times, each time creating a new shuffled random data, with the `category` column remaining the same and the `region` column shuffled each time in a random order. 

For each such simulation indexed $i$ compute the `category`-by-`region` occurance table and the resulting $\chi^2$ test statistic from 2.(g.) and call it $S_i$. <br>

Plot the empirical density distribution of the $S_i$ randomized test statistics and compare it to the theoretical density of the $\chi^2(27)$ distribution. Are the distributions similar? <br>

Finally, compute the empirical p-value, comparing the test statistic $S$ computed on the real data in 2.(g.) to the $1,000$ random statistics:  

$$

\widehat{Pval} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N 1_{\{S_i \geq S\}}.

$$

How different from the p-value obtained via the chi-square approximation? 





i. (8pt) Compute for each of the $50$ states (and `DC` - District of Columbia) in the US the number of tweets made by users from this state. <br>

Next, load the `usmap` library that contains the variable `statepop`. <br>

Use this variable to compute the number of tweets per million residents for each state. <br>

Remove `DC` and use the `usmap` package to make a map of USA states, where each state is colored by the number of tweets per million residents. <br>

Report the three states with the maximal and minimal number.

## Q1

# a
With two strong properties of the *exp* distribution first *memoryless* and that the minimum of independent  exp random variable is *exp* with parameter equal to sum of the parameters of exp random variables we took minimum on.I thought on the simulation that every time randomized a shot with minimum distribution of *exp* that will represents a shot that was taken and kill someone on the rival team. And by that keep randomized first shot's(with change parameter because the number of exp distribution is decreasing when someone is dead) until one team has zero mans alive and then ill count the number of alive persons in the **winning team**.


# b

here i simulate a shoot out with n statistican
```{r}
shootuot<-function(n) {
  team1<-n
  team2<-n
  while (team1>0&team2>0) {
  shooter1<-rexp(1,team1)
  shooter2<-rexp(1,team2)
  if(shooter1<shooter2){
    team2<-team2-1
  }
  else {
    team1=team1-1
  }
  }
  ifelse(team1==0,team2,team1)
}
```

Here i iterate the shoot out
```{r}

iteration<-function(iters,num_of_static) {
remain_life<-rep(0,iters)
for(i in c(1:iters)){
  remain_life[i] <- shootuot(num_of_static)
}
return(remain_life)
}
mean_test<-mean(iteration(1000,10))
var_test<-var(iteration(1000,10))
```

By the simulation we got that E[X]=`r mean_test` and V[X]=`r var_test`

# c


```{r}

start<-10
vec_of_means<-rep(0,log(10240,2)-log(10,2)+1)
for(i in c(1:length(vec_of_means))){
  vec_of_means[i]<-mean(iteration(100,start))
  start<-start*2
}

increasePower  <- function(v) { v ^ (0:(length(v)-1)) }
n_vec<-10*increasePower(rep(2,length(vec_of_means)))
par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means,xlab="number of shooters",
     ylab="estimate mean of Xn")
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means,log="xy",xlab="log scaled number of shooters",
     ylab="log scaled estimate mean of Xn",pch=8)
mtext("killing other team", side = 3, line = -1, outer = TRUE,cex = 1.25,font = 2)
abline(a = 0,b = 0.75,col="red")

```


Above we can see two plot *left* plot is the estimate vs number of shooters in each team and the 
*right* plot is a scatter plot of estimate vs number of shooters with log scale on both axis(x and y)
and the red line i added on that plot is the line $Y=0.75 x$ which we can see is very similar to the dot's
so we get $log(E[x])=0.75log(n)$ which from properties of log function we get the function
$f(n)=n^{\frac{3}{4}}$ holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$

# d


shooting you own team simulation
```{r}

modi_shootuot<-function(n) {
  team1<-n
  team2<-n
  while (team1>0&team2>0) {
  shooter1<-rexp(1,team1)
  shooter2<-rexp(1,team2)
  if(shooter1<shooter2){team1<-team1-1}
  else {team2<-team2-1}
  }
  ifelse(team1==0,team2,team1)
}

mody_iteration<-function(iters,num_of_static) {
remain_life<-rep(0,iters)
for(i in c(1:iters)){remain_life[i] <- modi_shootuot(num_of_static)}
return(remain_life)
}



start_2<-10
vec_of_means_2<-rep(0,log(10240,2)-log(10,2)+1)
for(i in c(1:length(vec_of_means_2))){
  vec_of_means_2[i]<-mean(mody_iteration(100,start_2))
  start_2<-start_2*2
}

mean_2<-round(mean(vec_of_means_2),3)
var_2<-round(var(vec_of_means_2),3)
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means_2,xlab="number of shooters",
     ylab="estimate mean of Xn",main="killing my team")
legend("bottomright",
       legend = c(paste("mean",as.character(mean(mean_2))), paste("var",as.character(var_2))))

```


Here we can see that the estimator is not dependent on the number of shooters which is big difference from the previous sun question and this is because if we will look at the denstyu graph of exp distribution we will notice that more the parameter is higher the density close to zero is higher and the slope is steep which mean that the probability to sample close to zero is higher and for that in C we have dependent on the number of shooters because the team that kills first have better chances to kill first again and so on. and here we have the opposite because every team every team reduce the chance to shot first and that why we see those result
and we can see that we have scatter around 2 so $f(n)=2$ holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$ in this case


# e


```{r}

drunk_shootuot<-function(n) {
  team1<-n
  team2<-n
  while (team1>0&team2>0) {
  shooter1<-rexp(1,team1)
  shooter2<-rexp(1,team2)
  if(shooter1<shooter2){
    drunk_shot<-rbernoulli(1,team2/(team1+team2))
    if (drunk_shot) {team2<-team2-1}
    else {team1<-team1-1}
  }else {
    drunk_shot<-rbernoulli(1,team1/(team1+team2))
    if (drunk_shot) {team1<-team1-1}
    else {team2<-team2-1}
  }
  }
  ifelse(team1==0,team2,team1)
}

drunk_iteration<-function(iters,num_of_static) {
remain_life_3<-rep(0,iters)
for(i in c(1:iters)){remain_life_3[i] <- drunk_shootuot(num_of_static)}
return(remain_life_3)
}


start_3<-10
vec_of_means_3<-rep(0,log(10240,2)-log(10,2)+1)
for(i in c(1:length(vec_of_means_3))){
  vec_of_means_3[i]<-mean(drunk_iteration(100,start_3))
  start_3<-start_3*2
}
mean_3<-round(mean(vec_of_means_3),3)
var_3<-round(var(vec_of_means_3),3)
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means_3,xlab="number of shooters",
     ylab="estimate mean of Xn",main="drunk teams")
legend("bottomright",
       legend = c(paste("mean",as.character(mean(mean_3))), paste("var",as.character(var_3))))
```


We have here similar result and this is because the chance to kill some one from the team with more alive people is higher because of the distribution of the bernoulli so that as in the previous case number of alive shooters is decreasing in joint way in each team and there for we get $f(n)=2$ holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$ in this case too

# f


```{r}
zombi_shootuot<-function(n) {
  team1<-n
  team2<-n
  while (team1>0&team2>0) {
  shooter1<-rexp(1,n)
  shooter2<-rexp(1,n)
  if(shooter1<shooter2){team1<-team1-1}
  else { team2<-team2-1}
  }
  ifelse(team1==0,team2,team1)
}

zombi_iteration<-function(iters,num_of_static) {
remain_life_4<-rep(0,iters)
for(i in c(1:iters)){remain_life_4[i] <- zombi_shootuot(num_of_static)}
return(remain_life_4)
}



start_4<-10
vec_of_means_4<-rep(0,log(10240,2)-log(10,2)+1)
for(i in c(1:length(vec_of_means_4))){
  vec_of_means_4[i]<-mean(zombi_iteration(100,start_4))
  start_4<-start_4*2
}
mean_4<-round(mean(vec_of_means_4),3)
var_4<-round(var(vec_of_means_4),3)
par(mfcol=c(1,2))
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means_4,xlab="number of shooters",
     ylab="estimate mean of Xn")
plot(x=n_vec,y=vec_of_means_4,log="xy",xlab="log scaled number of shooters",
     ylab="log scaled estimate mean of Xn",pch=8)
mtext("zombie fight", side = 3, line = -1, outer = TRUE,cex = 1.25,font = 2)
abline(a=0,b=0.5,col="red")

```


So here i presented two graphs with in the same way as i did in *c* with little difference that this time
the red line is $Y=0.5 x$ and therefor we got that $f(n)=n^{\frac{1}{2}}$ holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$
so the difference from the last two sub question is that now we have dependent on the number of shooters 
and the difference from *c* is that here our dependent in the number of shooter is weaker which we can see from the lower slope of our red line here(compared to c).

## Q2

# a


Read the data
```{r}

tweets<-read_csv("/Users/elkysandor/Downloads/crowdflower-2015-new-years-resolutions/data/new_years_resolutions_dfe.csv")

```
As we can see every column is in the right class

```{r}
nice_print<-within(tweets[1:2,], {text = paste(substr(text, 1, 15),
                                               "...", sep = "")})
knitr::kable(nice_print) 
```


```{r}
size<-dim(tweets)
nice_print_2<-within(tweets[(size[1]-1):size[1],], {text = paste(substr(text, 1, 15),
                                               "...", sep = "")})
knitr::kable(nice_print_2) 
```

# b


```{r}
only_time<- sub(".* ", "", tweets$tweet_created)
time_date<-as.POSIXct(only_time,format="%H:%M")
tms<-times(format(time_date, "%H:%M:%S"))
time<-mutate(tweets,"times"=tms)
ggplot(time,aes(x=times))+geom_histogram(binwidth = 1/24,boundary=0,color = "black",fill="skyblue",)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(0,1,1/24),4))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10, angle = 60, hjust = 1))

```


Here every bin is exactly one hour in the numeric representation so we can see that the hours with most tweets are 9-11 AM and 12-14 and the hours with the fewest hours are 2-4 AM 

# c


```{r,warning=FALSE}
to_plot_len<-dplyr::select(tweets,c(gender,tweet_region,resolution_category,text))
to_plot_len<-mutate(to_plot_len,length = nchar(tweets$text))
ggplot(to_plot_len,aes(x=length,y=gender,color=gender))+geom_boxplot()+stat_summary(fun="mean")
```


We can see from the graph that the difference between male and female is little with female have a little bit longest tweets on average.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(to_plot_len,aes(x=length,y=tweet_region,color=tweet_region))+geom_boxplot()+stat_summary(fun="mean")
```


There is not major difference in the length of the tweets per region
```{r,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(to_plot_len,aes(x=length,y=resolution_category,color=resolution_category))+geom_boxplot()+stat_summary(fun="mean")
```


The longest tweets are from philanthropic category(by average). and the smallest are from Humor((by average))

Used regex to remove what was asked to remove
```{r}

# e


Here my frequency table is *big mat* and *delta_fric* is the table of the measure D 
```{r}
words_only<-as.character(top_100_words$x)
for_num_per<-dplyr::select(tweets,c(tweet_region,resolution_category,retweet_count,))
freq_cat<-as.data.frame(table(tweets$resolution_category))
colnames(freq_cat)[1]<-"category"
freq_cat$category<-as.character(freq_cat$category)
big_mat<-matrix(nrow = 100,ncol = 10)
for (i in 1:length(words_only)) {
  for (j in 1:length(freq_cat$category)) {
    per_cat<-filter(tweets,resolution_category==freq_cat$category[j])
    text_only<-per_cat[["text"]]
    num_of_apper<-length(grep(words_only[i],text_only))
    big_mat[i,j]<-num_of_apper
  }
}
for (i in 1:dim(freq_cat)[1]) {big_mat[,i]<-big_mat[,i]/freq_cat$Freq[i]}
delta_fric<-matrix(nrow = 100,ncol = 10)
for (i in 1:100) {
  for (j in 1:10) {delta_fric[i,j]<-big_mat[i,j]-max(big_mat[i,][-j])}
}
most_charc<-df <- matrix(nrow = 10,ncol = 4)
for (j in 1:10) {
  chosen<-words_only[which(delta_fric[,j]%in%sort(delta_fric[,j],decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])]
  most_charc[j,]<-c(freq_cat$category[j],chosen)
}
most_charc<-as.data.frame(most_charc)
colnames(most_charc)<-c("category","word1","word2","word3")
knitr::kable(most_charc)
```
As we can see the words make sense with the categories

# f

```{r,warning=FALSE}
for_num_per<-dplyr::select(tweets,c(tweet_region,resolution_category))
per_cat<-group_by(for_num_per,resolution_category)%>%count()
per_cat_reg<-group_by(for_num_per,tweet_region,resolution_category)%>%count()
ggplot(per_cat,aes(x=resolution_category,y=n,color=resolution_category))+
  geom_point()+ylab("number of tweet's")+
  geom_text(label=as.character(per_cat$n), 
    nudge_x = 0.3, nudge_y = 0.5, 
    check_overlap = T)+coord_flip()+ylim(c(0,2000))

```


```{r,warning=FALSE}
table_by_rg<-dcast(per_cat_reg, resolution_category~tweet_region, value.var="n")
knitr::kable(table_by_rg)
```


# g 


```{r}
e_dot_j<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_rg[,2:5], 2, sum))
e_i_dot<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_rg[,2:5], 1, sum))
e_dot_dot<-sum(e_dot_j)
statis_S<-c()
for (i in 1:10) {
  for (j in 1:4) {
    eij<-(e_dot_j[j]*e_i_dot[i])/e_dot_dot
    statis_S<-c(statis_S,((table_by_rg[i,j+1]-eij)^2)/eij)
  }
}
statis_S<-sum(statis_S)
p_val_1<-1-pchisq(statis_S,27)
```

We got p_val equal to `r round(p_val_1,3)` which is high p_val which mean we wont reject the null hypothesis

```{r}
for_num_per_2<-dplyr::select(tweets,c(gender,resolution_category))
per_gen<-group_by(for_num_per_2,gender,resolution_category)%>%count()
table_by_gn<-dcast(per_gen, resolution_category~gender, value.var="n")
e_dot_j_2<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_gn[,2:3], 2, sum))
e_i_dot_2<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_gn[,2:3], 1, sum))
e_dot_dot_2<-sum(e_dot_j_2)
statis_S_2<-c()
for (i in 1:10) {
  for (j in 1:2) {
    eij_2<-(e_dot_j_2[j]*e_i_dot_2[i])/e_dot_dot_2
    statis_S_2<-c(statis_S_2,((table_by_gn[i,j+1]-eij_2)^2)/eij_2)
  }
}
statis_S_2<-sum(statis_S_2)
p_val_2<-1-pchisq(statis_S_2,9)


```

We got p_val so small that R return p_val equals to `r p_val_2` which mean that from the chi squared test 
we got significant difference in the distributions of categories between males and females.

# h

```{r}
for_chi<-dplyr::select(tweets,resolution_category,tweet_region)
all_S<-c()
for (i in 1:1000) {
  for_chi$tweet_region<-for_chi$tweet_region[sample(1:dim(for_chi)[1])]
  per_cat_reg_2<-group_by(for_chi,tweet_region,resolution_category)%>%count()
  table_by_rg_2<-dcast(as.data.table(per_cat_reg_2), resolution_category~tweet_region, value.var="n")
  table_by_rg_2<-as.data.frame(table_by_rg_2)
  e_dot_j<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_rg_2[,2:5], 2, sum))
  e_i_dot<-as.numeric(apply(table_by_rg_2[,2:5], 1, sum))
  e_dot_dot<-sum(e_dot_j)
  statis_S_3<-c()
  for (i in 1:10) {
    for (j in 1:4) {
      eij<-(e_dot_j[j]*e_i_dot[i])/e_dot_dot
      statis_S_3<-c(statis_S_3,((table_by_rg_2[i,j+1]-eij)^2)/eij)
    }
  }
  statis_S_3<-sum(statis_S_3)
  all_S<-c(all_S,statis_S_3)
}
all_S<-as.data.frame(all_S)


ggplot(all_S,aes(all_S))+geom_density(color="blue",fill="skyblue")+stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 27),color="red")
numeric_pval<-length(all_S$all_S[which(all_S$all_S>statis_S)])/1000
```
 As we can see the distributions are similar
 and we got that the empirical p_val is `r numeric_pval` and the difference is `r round(abs(numeric_pval-p_val_1),4)`
 which pretty low

```{r}
per_stat<-tweets%>% dplyr::select(tweet_state)%>%group_by(tweet_state)%>%count()
full_pic<-full_join(statepop,per_stat,by = c("abbr"="tweet_state") )
full_pic$pop_2015<-full_pic$pop_2015/1000000
colnames(full_pic)[4]<-"pop_2015_per_M"
full_pic<-mutate(full_pic,tweet_per_M=n/pop_2015_per_M)
full_pic<-full_pic[-which(full_pic$abbr=="DC"),]
pic<-plot_usmap(data = full_pic,exclude ="DC" ,values = "tweet_per_M", color = "red",labels = TRUE) + 
  scale_fill_continuous(
    low = "white", high = "red", name = "tweet per million", label = scales::comma
  )+theme(legend.position = "right") 
pic$layers[[2]]$aes_params$size <- 1.5
print(pic)

```

As we can see the three Countries with maximal number of tweets per million are
*New York*, *Alaska* and *Massachusetts*
and the three Countries with minimal number of tweets per million are
*North Dakota*, *Montana* and *Delaware*
